    "# IT Specialist Salary Prediction\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "The \"IT Specialist Salary Prediction\" project is designed to create a machine learning model that predicts the salaries of IT specialists based on a comprehensive survey. The project is based on the data gathrered from IT professionals through a detailed survey covering demographics, professional backgrounds, technical skills, education, and salary information, sourced from Kaggle [IT Salary Survey for EU region(2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/2020-it-salary-survey-for-eu-region). \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the project is to gain insights and knowledge about machine learning models capable of performing regression tasks. The project contains the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Collection**: The project gathers data from IT professionals through a detailed survey covering demographics, professional backgrounds, technical skills, education, and salary information, sourced from Kaggle, a renowned data science community and dataset repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The project includes thorough EDA to gain insights into the dataset, uncover patterns, and understand the relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Preparation**: Collected data undergoes extensive preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Learning Models**: The heart of the project is the development and training of machine learning models for salary prediction. This includes the application of Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Deployment**: The final model is deployed using Flask interface that allows usint REST Api for getting the salary predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Containerization**: The project code is containerized using Docker to ensure portability and ease of deployment.\n"
